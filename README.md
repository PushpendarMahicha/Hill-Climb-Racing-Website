# Hill-Climb-Racing-Website
I collaborated with friends to create a fully functional website inspired by the game ‘Hill Climb Racing’ developed by Fingersoft. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and PHP and MySQL for the backend, we built a clone of the original Fingersoft site. Our version includes additional features, interactive animations, and enhancements.”
